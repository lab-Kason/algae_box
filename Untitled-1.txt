=== PLITT MODEL FOR HYDROCYCLONE SEPARATION ===

Formula for cut size d50c (particle diameter with 50% separation probability):

d50c = [39.7 × Dc^0.46 × Di^0.6 × Do^1.21 × Du^0.71 × exp(0.063φ)] / [h^0.38 × Q^0.45 × (ρs - ρf)^0.5]

VARIABLES (Design Parameters):
- Dc = Cyclone body diameter (mm) - main chamber diameter
- Di = Inlet diameter (mm) - where feed enters
- Do = Overflow/vortex finder diameter (mm) - top outlet for light particles
- Du = Underflow/apex diameter (mm) - bottom outlet for heavy particles
- h = Cylindrical section height (mm) - length of main chamber

VARIABLES (Operating Conditions):
- Q = Volumetric flow rate (L/min) - feed rate
- φ = Solids concentration (volume %) - algae concentration in feed
- ρs = Particle density (kg/m³) - density of algae cells
- ρf = Fluid density (kg/m³) - density of water/medium

OUTPUT:
- d50c = Cut size (μm) - particle size with 50% separation efficiency
  * Particles larger than d50c → mostly go to underflow (collected)
  * Particles smaller than d50c → mostly go to overflow (remain in water)

TYPICAL ALGAE VALUES:
- Algae cell size: 2-50 μm (varies by species)
- Algae density: ~1050-1100 kg/m³
- Water density: ~1000 kg/m³
